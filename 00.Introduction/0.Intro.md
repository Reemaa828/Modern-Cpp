# Introduction

# What's c++?
c++ is a standardized, general purpose, object oriented compiled language.
which means that it's a portable language that a developer can write code and the code will behave the same on different systems or platforms.
it's a fast language because it's compiled and not interpreted line by line at runtime.
>[!NOTE]
>- Portability in C++ does not mean in the compiled executable but in the source code, where it will do the same functionality on different platforms (window,linux,macos)
>- when compiled it will produce a machine code, that machine code is platform specific so you need to recompile to work it on different platform. 
>- for example: compiled c++ application on windows will not work on linux

# Why c++?
- closest to  hardware
- fast language (compiled)
- it has it's presence in almost every area of software development
   - **Application Software Development**
   - **Games Development**
   - **Embedded System**

# C++ origin
invented by `Bjarne Stroustrup` at bell labs in 1979. it was firstly called `c with classes`

>[!TIP]
> - Every C++ standard, starting with C++11 onward, is referred to as “modern C++.”

# c++ source code is platform dependent but machine independent
platform dependent cause every os may have it's own system calls , libraries...
but machine independent means the source code will not be modified to work on different machine.
# Getting Started on Linux 🚀 

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential #on ubuntu
g++ -v #to confirm
```
