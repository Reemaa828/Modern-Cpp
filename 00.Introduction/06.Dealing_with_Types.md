# C++ Dealing with Types

# What's type aliases and Why do we need them?
- A type alias is a name that is a synonym for another type.
-  we need it cause 
     1. it let us emphasize the purpose for which a type is used.
- We can define a type alias in one of two ways.
     1. `typedef`
     2. `using`
  # `typedef`

- The keyword `typedef` may appear as part of the base type of a declaration.
- Declarations that include `typedef` define type aliases rather than variables.
- the declarators can include type modifiers (* ,&) that define compound types built from the base type of the definition.

# `using` or alias declaration

- An alias declaration starts with the keyword using followed by the alias name and an =.
  # Type aliases with compound types
for example
```c++
typedef char *pstring; //pstring is a pointer to character
//the following declarations use the type pstring, which is an alias for the the //type char*
```
## Type aliases with compound types and const
for example
```c++
typedef char *pstring;
const pstring cstr = 0; // cstr is a constant pointer to char
const pstring *ps; // ps is a pointer to a constant pointer to char
```
- The base type in these declarations is `const pstring`. As usual, a const that appears in the base type modifies the given type.
- The type of `pstring` is “pointer to char.” So, const `pstring` is a constant pointer to char—not a pointer to const char.

# The auto Type Specifier
- auto tells the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer.
- a variable that uses auto as its type specifier must have an initializer.

>[!NOTE]
>Because a declaration can involve only a single base type, the initializers for all the variables in the declaration must have types that are consistent with each other, when using auto type specifier.
>```c++
>auto i = 0, *p = &i; // ok: i is int and p is a pointer to int
>auto sz = 0, pi = 3.14;// error: inconsistent types for sz and pi
>```
## auto type with compound type and const

- the compiler doesn't usually guess the type specified by auto correctly.
- the compiler adjusts the type to conform to normal initialization rules.
for example:
when we use a reference, we are really using the object to which the reference refers. In particular, when we use a reference as an initializer, the initializer is the corresponding object.

- auto ordinarily ignores top-level consts.

- we want the deduced type to have a top-level const, we must say so explicitly.

- we ask for a reference to an auto-deduced type, top-level consts in the initializer are not ignored. As usual, consts are not top-level when we bind a reference to an initializer. `(following the initialization rules) that a constant object can never be bind to nonconst reference`
- it is important to remember that a reference or pointer is part of a particular declarator and not part of the base type for the declaration.
- if we want a reference to be auto-deduced the top-level const is not ignored cause in initialization rules the const object is always referred to by a const reference.
# The `decltype` Type Specifier

if we want the compiler to deduce a type by expression without using this expression as a initializer, we can use `decltype`.
This is particularly useful when you need to know the type of a variable or the return type of a function but don't want to execute the expression or use it to initialize anything.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>- The way `decltype` handles `top-level const` and references is different than `auto`.
>- When the expression to which we apply `decltype` is a variable, `decltype` returns the type of that variable, including top-level const and `references`.

- when you use an expression(not a variable) the compiler analyze the expression and deduce the type from what that expression yields.
- `decltype` returns a reference type for expressions that yield objects that can stand on the left-hand side of the assignment.

- `decltype` depends on the form of its given expression. 
     -    When we apply `decltype` to a variable without any parentheses, we get the type of that variable.
    - . If we wrap the variable’s name in one or more sets of parentheses, the compiler will evaluate the operand as an expression.
